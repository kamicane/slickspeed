<h2>Speed/validity selectors test for frameworks.</h2>
<p>Every framework runs in his own iFrame, thus no conflicts can happen. Tests are run selector by selector, with an interval to prevent the browser from freeezing.</p>
<p>Tests are run in a neutral environment, no library or framework is included in the main javascript test.</p>
<p>Under firefox, disable firebug for more accurate results, as most frameworks could throw warnings, slowing down the dom query process.</p>

<p>Tests are run against a local copy of <a href="template.html">this document</a>.</p>
